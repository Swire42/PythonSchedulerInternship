- I was not able to make the `make` (default target) approach work on a real machine: Freezing at "Loading initial ramdisk ..."
- `make deb-pkg` did not work ethier at first. (same)
- but I ended up noticing a warning issued by the `deb-pkg` target, talking about the name of the folder in which we build the kernel.
- Changing the folder name to the name in the warning seems to somehow fix the problem.
