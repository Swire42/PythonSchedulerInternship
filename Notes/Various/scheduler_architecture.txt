Using the C++ library, a scheduler can be implemented by inheriting from BasicDispatchScheduler.
One also needs an agent, inheriting from Agent.

The core of a Scheduler is Agent::AgentThread().
This function usually:
- loops forever
- consumes messages from the kernel and use Scheduler::DispatchMessage(msg)
- call the main Scheduling function

The main scheduling function is usually responsible for making transactions, that is telling the kernel what to schedule.

DispatchMessage calls the (overrided) handling function corresponding to the message type.
This can be Scheduler::TaskNew, for instance.

Most of the logic hence resides in:
- The main scheduling function.
- Overrided functions such as TaskNew.
